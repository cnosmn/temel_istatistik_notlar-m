- Basic understanding of statistics and probability

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/statistics-analysis.git
cd statistics-analysis
```

2. Install required packages
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scipy seaborn statsmodels researchpy jupyter
```

## Usage

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open the `istatistik_not.ipynb` file in the Jupyter interface
3. Run cells sequentially to see the analysis and results

## Statistical Concepts Covered

The notebook covers the following statistical concepts:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean, standard deviation, variance
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understanding relationships between variables
- **Covariance**: Measuring how variables change together
- **Probability Distributions**:
  - Bernoulli Distribution: For binary outcome events
  - Binomial Distribution: For number of successes in n independent trials
  - Poisson Distribution: For rare events in a fixed interval
  - Normal Distribution: For continuous random variables
- **Confidence Intervals**: Estimating population parameters
- **Hypothesis Testing**:
  - One-sample t-test
  - Independent two-sample t-test
  - Dependent two-sample t-test

## Libraries Used

- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `seaborn`: For data visualization and dataset loading
- `scipy.stats`: For statistical functions and probability distributions
- `statsmodels`: For advanced statistical modeling
- `researchpy`: For simplified statistical analysis
